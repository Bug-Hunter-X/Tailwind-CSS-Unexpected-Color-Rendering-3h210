```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This div should be red.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This div should be blue.
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet seems correct but produces unexpected results: both divs appear blue instead of red and blue. The issue is caused by incorrect order of classes in the Tailwind configuration file or a conflict with another CSS rule that overrides the `bg-red-500` class.

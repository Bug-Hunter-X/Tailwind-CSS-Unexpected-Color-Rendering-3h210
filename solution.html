<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">

The solution might involve checking your Tailwind configuration to ensure proper class order or inspecting your CSS for conflicting rules overriding the Tailwind classes.  In some cases, adding `!important` might be necessary (though it's generally discouraged) to ensure precedence.  More details about identifying and resolving the conflict are in the README.
